# Nepali Number Plate Recognition System
 Nepali License Number Plate Recognition is a technology that detects, recognize and tracks vehicles on the road. Today, the rise of automobile and accidents caused by them is a major source of concern in Nepal and other countries around the world. The main root causes of the problem include a lack of awareness and respect for traffic rules, reckless driving and high speed. These issues can be addressed by detecting and recognizing vehicles at the appropriate time. This project addresses the growing need for accurate Number Plate Recognition in intelligent transportation systems. The project aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of license plate recognition systems. The proposed system consists of combination of image processing technique and optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to extract information and accurately recognize and extract number plate information captured by live video feeds using surveillance camera. Hence, with this project we plan on offering a promising solution for improving traffic surveillance, enforcement efficiency and overall road safety
